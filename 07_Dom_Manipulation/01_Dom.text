Topic 1: What is the DOM?

----------------------------------------------- 

ðŸ’¡ What is DOM?

DOM is a programming interface provided by the browser that represents the entire HTML document as a tree of objects (called nodes).

- DOM stands for Document Object Model.

- It is a tree-like structure created by the browser when an HTML page is loaded.

- It represents all HTML elements as JavaScript objects.

- JavaScript can read, change, add, or delete HTML elements using the DOM.

----------------------------

Think of It Like This:

HTML is like a blueprint.

The browser reads it and creates a live structure (DOM) in memory.

JavaScript can then interact with this live structure, and make change in this structure.

<body>
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

DOM Tree:- 

Document
 â””â”€â”€ html
     â””â”€â”€ body
         â”œâ”€â”€ h1
         â””â”€â”€ p

DOM = Live representation of HTML

JavaScript uses it to change how your page looks and behaves

It's the bridge between static HTML and interactive pages

JavaScript uses the DOM to read, manipulate, and react to HTML content dynamically. 

Dom is very Very important for interactivity, UI control, and dynamic content.

// Root of DOM:-

  console.log(document); // Entire DOM
  console.log(document.body); // <body> element
  console.log(document.body.children); // All direct children of body
  console.log(document.body.firstElementChild); // <h1
