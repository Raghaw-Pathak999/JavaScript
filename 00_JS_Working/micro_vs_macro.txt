**Microtasks vs Macrotasks in Node.js & V8**

**1) The Big Picture**

When JavaScript code executes, after every execution context, Node.js/V8 checks certain queues to determine what runs next. These queues are:

* **Microtask Queue**: Tiny, high-priority tasks that should execute before any macrotask.
* **Macrotask Queue**: Scheduled tasks that are bigger and usually represent timers, I/O callbacks, or setImmediate in Node.js.

**Rule:** Microtasks always execute before the next macrotask.

**2) Microtasks (inside V8)**

**Examples:**

* Promise.then, Promise.catch, Promise.finally
* queueMicrotask
* MutationObserver (browser only)

**Features:**

* Very high priority.
* Executes immediately after the current stack finishes, **before any timers or I/O**.
* Fully drains: all microtasks run until the queue is empty.

**Example:**

console.log("A");
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("B"));
console.log("C");
// Output:
// A
// C
// B

**Explanation:**

* "A" prints first because it's synchronous.
* "C" prints second, still synchronous.
* Promise callback is microtask, executes immediately after stack finishes.

**3) Macrotasks (scheduled callbacks)**

**Examples:**

* setTimeout, setInterval
* setImmediate (Node.js only)
* I/O callbacks (network, fs)

**Features:**

* Run in later phases of the event loop.
* After a macrotask finishes, all microtasks queued during its execution will run before next macrotask.

**Example:**

setTimeout(() => console.log("timeout"), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log("immediate"));

* Actual execution order can vary slightly depending on Node.js version and context.

**4) Node.js twist: process.nextTick**

**Special queue** that runs **before microtasks**.

**Execution priority:**

1. Current stack finishes
2. All process.nextTick callbacks
3. Microtasks (Promises)
4. Macrotasks (timers, I/O, etc.)

**Example:**

setTimeout(() => console.log("timeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("promise"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick"));
console.log("sync");

// Output:
// sync
// nextTick
// promise
// timeout

**Explanation:**

* Synchronous code prints first.
* process.nextTick runs immediately after stack.
* Microtasks (Promises) execute next.
* Macrotasks (setTimeout) run last.

**5) Event Loop Integration**

1. Run main synchronous code.
2. Drain process.nextTick queue (Node-only).
3. Drain microtask queue (Promises, queueMicrotask).
4. Pick next macrotask from macrotask queue (timer callback, I/O callback, setImmediate).
5. After each macrotask, microtasks that were queued during its execution run immediately.
6. Repeat until all tasks are completed.

**Key Point:** Microtasks “sneak in” between every macrotask, ensuring high-priority tasks execute quickly.

**6) Why This Matters**

* Correctly understanding execution order prevents bugs and race conditions.
* Misplaced assumptions about when a callback will execute can break logic.
* nextTick can starve the event loop if abused (e.g., infinite scheduling).
* Promises ensure microtasks run before timers, keeping predictable order.

**Summary:**

* Microtasks: super high priority, drained after stack.
* Macrotasks: scheduled async callbacks, run in event loop phases.
* process.nextTick: Node-only, runs before microtasks.
* Understanding these queues is critical to avoiding unexpected async behavior in Node.js.
