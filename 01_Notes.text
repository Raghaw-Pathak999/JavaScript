### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

### Who Created JavaScript?

* **Creator:** Brendan Eich
* **Company:** Netscape Communications Corporation
* **Year:** 1995
* **Time Taken:** Just 10 days to develop the initial version

Initially called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, and finally renamed to **JavaScript** for marketing reasons, to leverage the popularity of Java at the time.

> Note: JavaScript has no direct connection to Java. The naming was a strategic decision.

### Why Was JavaScript Created?

In the mid-1990s, websites were static and lacked interactivity. Netscape wanted a lightweight, easy-to-learn scripting language to:

* Run directly in browsers
* Respond to user actions
* Enhance user experience

Brendan Eich built the first version of JavaScript to meet these needs.

### Where is JavaScript Used?

#### 1. Client-Side (Browser)

* Form validation
* Page interactions (clicks, hovers)
* DOM manipulation
* Animations
* AJAX for data fetching

#### 2. Server-Side (Using Node.js)

* Building APIs
* Real-time applications (chats, games)
* File system handling
* Server logic

#### 3. Mobile Development

* Using React Native, Ionic, etc.

#### 4. Desktop Applications

* Using Electron.js (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
